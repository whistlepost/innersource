Resources to assist the implementation of an Inner Souce model for organisational code management

## Introduction

Inner Source is a term used to collectively describe the adoption of Open Source practices and processes to manage code within an organisation.

Some of the benefits of a Inner Source approach are listed below.

## Community

One important aspect of successful Open Source projects is that they are based around a community of individuals working towards common goals. In this sense the focus is not primarily on individual concerns, but rather on maturing the code itself.

This is a very important distinction from the traditional approach of teams focused on addressing their own concerns and implementing solutions that are not designed for consumption outside of the implementing team.

## Modularity

A prominent trait in Open Source projects is that they are designed in a modular way to ensure the greatest interoperability possible. Solutions that are restricted in scope and purpose are less likely to be successful as the designers cannot always forsee every possible use-case for the code.

So by designing with modularity in mind a code solution has a greater potential to be used in a broader range of use-cases.

## Transparency

In order to be successful Open Source projects require promotion and inclusiveness to foster the community surrounding the project. Teams need to be open and communicative from the outset, ensuring they respond in a timely manner to requests and address needs and concerns of the wider community.

Organisations often have challenges around cross-team communications, and the transparency required to implement a successful Inner Source project can assist to improve the communications across the organisation-wide community.
